# Maskman

Maskman is a utility for generating hex masks. Its initial development
was targeted at masks to help set affinity within applications through
MPI and HPC scheduler environments.

Use it if you:
- want to quickly investigate affinity mappings that, when found, will
  serve as the target for simpler scheduler- and/or MPI-centric
  command line arguments
- need settings that simple scheduler and MPI command line arguments
  are unable to provide
